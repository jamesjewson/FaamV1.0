# A Little Bit About This Project

This website started out as my first serious attempt at learning React, and began with [this tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFHyZvVxce0) While the tutorial was a good start, I have spent hundreds of hours modifying the layout, organization, and overall look and feel of the website. This site features completely custom CSS, a logo designed and created by me, and a normalized database. 
I have learned an indcredible amount building this website. It has solidified my ability to use React hooks, components, props, states, and effects. It has given me the opportunity to learn how to write MongoDB queries. It also allowed me to work on a project initially designed by someone else, and build off of it into something I can call my own.
